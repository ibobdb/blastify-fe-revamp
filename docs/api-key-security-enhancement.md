# API Key Security Enhancement - Password Validation

## Overview

Enhanced the API Key Table component to require password validation for sensitive actions such as viewing API keys and copying them to clipboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Password Validation Service (`auth.service.ts`)

- Added `validatePassword` function that makes an API call to validate the current user's password
- Function validates against the logged-in user's credentials

### 2. Password Validation Dialog Component (`password-validation-dialog.tsx`)

- Created a reusable dialog component for password validation
- Features:
  - Password input with show/hide toggle
  - Loading state during validation
  - Toast notifications for success/error
  - Keyboard support (Enter to submit)
  - Customizable title, description, and action label

### 3. Auth Context Updates (`auth.context.tsx`)

- Added `validatePassword` method to the auth context interface
- Integrated password validation into the global auth state management

### 4. API Key Table Security Enhancement (`api-key-table.tsx`)

- Updated sensitive actions to require password validation:
  - **View API Key**: Toggle visibility now requires password
  - **Copy API Key**: Copying the full API key requires password
  - **Copy API Key ID**: Copying the API key ID requires password
- Added state management for:
  - Password dialog visibility
  - Pending actions that require validation
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Security Features

### Protected Actions

1. **View API Key**: Users must enter their password to see the full API key value
2. **Copy Operations**: All copy operations (key and ID) now require password validation
3. **User Session Validation**: Password is validated against the current logged-in user

### User Experience

- Clear feedback through toast notifications
- Loading states during validation
- Intuitive password input with show/hide functionality
- Cancellation support for all dialogs

## API Endpoint Requirements

The implementation expects the following API endpoint:

```
POST /auth/validate-password
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

{
  "password": "user_password"
}

Response:
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Password is valid"
}
```

## Usage Example

```tsx
// The password validation is automatically triggered when users:
// 1. Click the eye icon to view an API key
// 2. Click the copy button for API key or ID
// 3. Use the dropdown menu copy actions

// No additional code needed - the validation is built into the existing UI
```

## Testing

A test page has been created at `/dashboard/password-test` to verify the password validation dialog functionality independently.

## Security Benefits

1. **Two-Factor Protection**: Sensitive data access requires both authentication and password re-verification
2. **Session Validation**: Ensures the current user is still valid and authorized
3. **Audit Trail**: All password validation attempts can be logged on the backend
4. **User Awareness**: Users are explicitly aware when accessing sensitive data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for password validation attempts
2. **Session Timeout**: Auto-lock sensitive actions after periods of inactivity
3. **Biometric Support**: Add fingerprint/face recognition for supported devices
4. **Admin Override**: Allow administrators to bypass validation for emergency access
